## General Info

This repo includes a visual sorting tool devoloped using the default react app setup. Included are 6 sorting algorithms, 5 sorting speeds, and 5
different sized array controls.

## Project Idea

The general idea of the tool is to have an array of unsorted values generated and displayed to the window. Selecting a algorithm and starting the sort should result in a visual animation of the selected algorithm, through which the user can see what the algorithm focuses on and how it sorts the array. The focus of the algorithm is shown using color changes for array index's being compared.

## Included Algorithms

Each algorithm file included has a short pseudo description of the basic idea of the algorithm.
